# Caboodle

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

## Dependencies

To properly run this application requires Angular 6 and above, Node 8.11.1, and Bootstrap 4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To run server you need to 'npm run build:server && npm run serve:server', for UI development you can still use 'ng serve'.

## Code scaffolding
